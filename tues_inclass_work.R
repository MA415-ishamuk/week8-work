# can use quick stats through USDA to develop data sets picking the variable that
# you are particularly interested in --> strawberry, chemicals, economics, etc

# when writing make a file called myfunctions.R and list all the used functions 
# there then use source("myfunctions.R") to access those functions from elsewhere'


# start of code that can be used to organize the chemicals used
# chemical_counts <- survey_chem %>%
#   group_by(`Chemical Name`) %>%
